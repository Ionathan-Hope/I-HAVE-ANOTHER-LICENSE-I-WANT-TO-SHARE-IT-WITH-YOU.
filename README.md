# The View License
The View License is a humorous public domain-equivalent license. 
The license is badly formed, with improper spelling and grammar, repetitive error messages, and the only real content is below: {{{

## The View License
Copyleft (É”) _year_ _organization_.
All rights reversed.

}}} All the rest is humorous.
